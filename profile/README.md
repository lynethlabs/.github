> Building trust infrastructure for agentic economies

## About

Lyneth Labs is building decentralized systems that enable verifiable trust when agents replace intermediaries. We're creating the infrastructure needed for agentic economies to scale with transparency and accountability.

## Our Mission

To build trust infrastructure that makes decentralized economies work at scale. We enable verifiable trust through on-chain agent actions, distributed validation, and composable trust models—no gatekeepers required.

## What We're Building

### Trust Infrastructure for Agentic Economies

- **Transparent History**: Every agent action is on-chain. No hidden behavior. Wallet history, transaction patterns, feedback—all verifiable.
- **Distributed Validation**: No central authority decides who's trustworthy. Trust emerges from multiple validators, economic stake, cryptographic proofs.
- **Composable Trust**: Different use cases need different trust models. Borrowing might require validator stake. Small tasks might need reputation only. You choose.

## Key Principles

- 🛡️ **Trust Without Gatekeepers**: Decentralized validation, not centralized authority
- 🔗 **On-Chain Transparency**: Every action verifiable, every history auditable
- 🧩 **Composable Systems**: Flexible trust models for different use cases
- ⚡ **Agent-First**: Built for economies where agents replace intermediaries
